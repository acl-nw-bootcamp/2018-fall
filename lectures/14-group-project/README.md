# Class 14 -  Project Week: Requirements

## Final Project Rules and Process
For your final project, your task is to work with a team to build a web site that simulates a real-world product, service, or game.

**Rules:**

Your team must adhere to the following requirements.
* There can be no more than 4 people per team.
* Each person must make meaningful contributions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* The web site must have at least 3 interlinked pages and clear navigation.
* The web site must have at least 2 pages that accept and process user input.
* The web site's state must persist between page reloads.
* The web site must make use of data that is stored in a database.
* The site data must be modifiable by a user of the site (either a general user, account user, or admin user).
* The web site must also utilize information from an external API.
* 3rd party libraries should be used, such as JQuery, Handlebars, etc.
* The web site should be designed in accordance with Mobile First practices.

**Process:**

Here's the process that we'll be using for project week.
1. On the first day of project week, your team must submit a proposal to an instructor.
2. During project week, your team must work on-campus so we can help whenever your team is stuck.
3. On the last day of project week, your team must present your project in front of the class.


## Project proposals

1. On the first day of project week, your team must submit a proposal to an instructor with the following information:

 - Your team's name
 - Your team's members
 - Your project's pitch. (What is the problem statement and what are the benefits of your solution? Read more about these [here](https://www.bidsketch.com/proposal-resources/proposal-templates/web-design-proposal-template).)
 - A diagram of relevant details from your project's domain model
 - A few wireframe sketches of your project's pages

 **TIP:** Use pencil and paper to diagram and sketch.

   Proposals, written or electronic, as per the project description, are due for review with the instruction team. First come, first served!


2. Here are some tips on how to organize your team during the launch phase.

 * Elect a Launch Driver who will be responsible for the following:
    * Driving the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
    * Hosting the code under their GitHub account (or create a new GitHub organization for your team and an organizational repo for the project) 
 * The rest of the team will be Launch Navigators and responsible for the following:
      * Navigating the coding of the initial scaffolding phase.
      * Staying one-step ahead of the Launch Driver by researching unfamiliar technology.
 * Once everyone is in agreement, here's how to launch a new  project.
      * Build a basic file scaffold from scratch **as a team**.
      * Initialize a new git repository (in a personal or organization account).
      * Push it to GitHub and [add your team members as Collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).
      * (Optional) Deploy it to Heroku and [add your team members as Collaborators](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sharing).

Make a plan, and get to work!
