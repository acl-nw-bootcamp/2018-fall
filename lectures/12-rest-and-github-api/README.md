## Notes

Topic 1 - REST & APIs

* REST
    * Constraints - what makes something RESTful?
        * client - server relationship
        * stateless server
        * uses HTTP methods
        * URLs are easy to understand
        * Data is sent as JSON or XML
            
* API's
    * What is an API?
    * What is a RESTful API?
        * an API that follows the following guidelines:
            * has a base url
            * uses HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE 
            * sends an internet media type (like JSON or XML)
    * [programmableweb.com directory](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis)
    * Examples:
        * [the cat api (note: returns XML!)](http://thecatapi.com/)
        * [marvel api (needs a key)](http://developer.marvel.com/docs)

* Demo - How
    * Head to GitHub and see how to request a token to be able to access the API appropriately.
       * Login at GitHub.com
       * In the upper right, click on your face, and head to settings
       * Scroll to the Developer Settings section on the left side.
       * Click on Personal access tokens
       * Now click Generate new token, towards the upper right
       * Confirm login.
       * Enter token description as ‘repos’ or something simple.
       * Check the single ‘repo’ check box for repo scope (this will automatically check the sub boxes).
       * Now scroll to the bottom and select Generate token
       * Save this token! GitHub will only display it to you **one time**
