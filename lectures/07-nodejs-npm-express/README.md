## Notes
- Let's quickly review the WRRC
- What is NodeJS?
- What are NPM, dependencies, and `package.json`?

- **Two main ways of working with Node/NPM projects**
	- 1. The project is already made; you're just using it
		- Clone the repo (or a fork of it)
		- `cd` into the repo, verify that there is a `package.json` with dependencies listed in it, and run `npm install` in the terminal
		- A bunch of stuff should install into a `node_modules` directory that is created automatically, and you're ready to go!
	- 2. You are creating a new Node/NPM project
		- Once the project directory is scaffolded, run `npm init` in the terminal from the root level of the project directory
		- This will ask you a series of questions that will create and set up a `package.json` file
		- As you identify NPM packages you want to add as dependencies to your project and are ready to use them, enter `npm install --save <dependency_name>` in the terminal, which will save the dependencies into a newly created `node_modules` directory and also keep track of them in the `package.json`
		- Be sure to `.gitignore` your `node_modules` directory!
		- You're ready to share your project with the world!

- `npm i -g nodemon` FTW
- ExpressJS overview
- Let's clone a repo and look at how to get it up and running: [Hour Long Lunch](https://github.com/bentongreen/hour-long-lunch)

- Code demo: Let's make a Node-powered server!
	- `npm init` to initialize it as a Node project
	- Install: ExpressJS
	- Write server.js, some helpful docs:
		- [Node: 'require'](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_require_id)
		- [app.use()](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.use)
		- [app.get()](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.get.method)
		- [app.listen()](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.listen)
- Lab Prep
	- Let's review the starter code and TODOs!
