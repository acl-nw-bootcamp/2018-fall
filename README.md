# Bootcamp Part II: Intermediate Software Development

Welcome to Bootcamp Part II! This class builds on your fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, and general web development, to prepare you for the deep dive of any Career Track class.

# Introduction

We are going to learn about many different topics of web development. The overall structure of the course is based on a common design pattern for web applications: Model-View-Controller (MVC). During each two-week section, we'll explore one aspect of this pattern and other related topics.

The general course schedule is:

Full Time  | Topic
-----------|---------------
Week 1 & 2     | The View
Week 3 & 4     | The Model
Week 5 & 6     | The Controller
Week 7 & 8     | Project Week

## Class Resources

We will have our own GitHub Organization to manage all of our repositories. All lecture notes and information will be found in this repo, under that day's directory. Your labs will have their own repo within this organization.

## Slides from class

Any slides used during class will be uploaded to the associated lectures directory after class. Lecture outlines and notes will be in each lecture's directory's README.

## Assignments

Lab-time code assignments follow each class time. Find these assignments in the repos of each class folder. Generally, you'll have a "pair" assignment that you'll work on with a classmate, and an individual "sandbox" assignment in which you'll build up your own online portfolio. Useful for your coming career change!

- Instructions for completing assignments can be found in their README files. 
- Assignments will be submitted using a professional-grade [git-flow](GIT_FLOW.md) aka lots and lots of PR's.
